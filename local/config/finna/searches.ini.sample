; value.  Values on the right of the equal sign are text that will be run
; through the translation module and displayed on screen.
;
; Note: "year", "author" and "title" are special shortcut aliases for the

;
; Available modules recommended for use in the side area:
;
; CatalogResults:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Display catalog search results matching the terms found in the specified
;       GET parameter (default = "lookfor"), limited to a specified number of
;       matches (default = 5).  This is designed for use with non-catalog modules.
; DPLATerms:[collapsed]
;       Display results from the DPLA catalog. Provide a boolean to have the sidebar
;       collapsed or open on page load.
; EDSResults:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Display EDS search results matching the terms found in the specified
;       GET parameter (default = "lookfor"), limited to a specified number of
;       matches (default = 5).
; EDSResultsDeferred:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Same as EDSResults, but loaded via AJAX.
; EPFResults:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Display EPF (EBSCO Publication Finder) search results matching the terms
;       found in the specified GET parameter (default = "lookfor"), limited to a
;       specified number of matches (default = 5).
; EPFResultsDeferred:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Same as EPFResults, but loaded via AJAX.
; EuropeanaResults:[url]:[requestParam]:[limit]:[unwanted data providers]
;       Display search results from Europeana.eu API.
;       Parameters (all are optional):
;         [url] = base search URL, default api.europeana.eu/api/v2/opensearch.rss
;         [requestParam] = parameter name for passing lookup value in url, default is
;             "searchTerms"
;         [limit] = the number of result items to display (defaults to 5)
;         [unwanted data providers] = comma separated list of dataproviders to ignore
;             results from; useful for excluding your own results that are also in
;             Europeana.
;       An API key must be set in config.ini (see europeanaAPI setting in [Content]
;       section).
; EuropeanaResultsDeferred:[url]:[requestParam]:[limit]:[unwanted data providers]
;       See EuropeanaResults, but this version uses AJAX for asynchronous loading.
; ExpandFacets:[ini section]:[ini name]
;       Display facets listed in the specified section of the specified ini file;
;       if [ini name] is left out, it defaults to "facets."  Rather than using
;       facets to limit the existing search, this module uses them to start a new
;       search showing all records matching the selected facet value.
; FacetCloud:[ini section]:[ini name]
;       Same functionality as ExpandFacets, but with a more compact interface to
;       allow the display of more values.
; LibGuidesProfile
;       Display a single LibGuides Profile for a LibGuides user (likely a librarian)
;       who owns a subject guide whose title most closely matches the search terms.
;       Uses configuration in LibGuidesAPI.ini and requires configuration in
;       contentsecuritypolicy.ini.
; LibGuidesResults:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Display LibGuides research guides search results matching the terms found in
;       the specified GET parameter (default = "lookfor"), limited to a specified
;       number of matches (default = 5).

;       the specified GET parameter (default = "lookfor"), limited to a specified
;       number of matches (default = 5).
; LibGuidesAZResultsDeferred:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Same as LibGuidesAZResults, but loaded via AJAX.
; OpenLibrarySubjects:[GET parameter]:[limit]:[date filter]:[Subject types]
;       Display full-text, public scans from the Open Library (OL) Subjects API.
;       [GET parameter] (default = "lookfor"), [limit] (default = 5),
;       [date filter] The name of a date filter (from facet settings) to apply to
;           searches.  Defaults to "publishDate" if blank; set to "false" to disable.
;       [Subject types] (default = "topic") comma-separated list of subject types to
;           test. Open Library distinguishes between the following subject types:
;           topic,place,person,time
;       Note: an API call will be made for each type until valid data is returned
;           which will slow down the loading of the main VuFind result set,
;           see OpenLibrarySubjectsDeferred
; OpenLibrarySubjectsDeferred:[GET parameter]:[limit]:[date filter]:[Subject types]
;       The same as OpenLibrarySubjects but uses AJAX to make the API calls after the
;           main result set has loaded
; RandomRecommend:[backend]:[limit]:[display mode]:[random mode]:[minimumset]
;        :[facet1]:[facetvalue1]:[facet2]:[facetvalue2]:...:[facet-n]:[facetvalue-n]
;       This module offers random records either from the whole backend or within
;       the current resultset.
;       [backend] is the name of the search backend currently in use,
;       which will help with accurate analysis (default = Solr)
;       [limit] is the number of records to display (default = 10)
;       [display mode] determines how the records are displayed. Valid values are
;       "standard" (for a basic display including titles and authors),
;       "images" for just images or "mixed" for both. (default = standard)
;       [random mode] determines if the records are selected from the entire backend
;       or from the current result set. Valid values are "retain" to limit results
;       to the current result set or "disregard" to use the entire backend.
;       (default = retain)
;       [minimumset] is the minimum result set count required to display random items,
;       0 = no minimum required. This setting can be used to prevent random items
;       displaying in a small result set. (default = 0)
;       [facet-n] A facet to apply to the random selection
;       [facetvalue-n] The facet value to apply to the random selection
; SideFacets:[regular facet section]:[checkbox facet section]:[ini name]
;       :[include dynamic checkboxes]
;       Display the specified facets, where [ini name] is the name of an ini file
;       in your config directory (defaults to "facets" if not supplied),
;       [regular facet section] is the name of a section of the ini file containing
;       standard facet settings (defaults to "Results" if not specified),
;       [checkbox facet section] is the name of a section of the ini file
;       containing checkbox facet settings (leave blank for no checkbox facets), and
;       [include dynamic checkboxes] is a true/false value indicating whether or not
;       to display dynamically-generated checkbox facets (it defaults to true, but
;       if you use multiple instances of SideFacets to split up your display, you
;       should set it to false in all but one of the instances to avoid duplication).
;       Checkbox facets are normally in filter => label format; prefix the section
;       name with ~ to reverse this and use label => filter format (useful if your
;       filters contain values that are illegal in configuration keys -- e.g. []).
;       Note that if you take advantage of this ~ feature, you will also need to
;       adjust the facets.ini Advanced_Settings/special_facets checkboxes setting
;       in order to properly display checkboxes on the advanced search screen.
; SpellingSuggestions
;       Display spelling suggestions (also requires Spelling settings to be turned
;       on in config.ini).
; SummonBestBets:[GET parameter]
;       Display Summon-generated "best bets" recommendations matching the terms found
;       in the specified GET parameter.  NOTE: If you are using this module with a
;       Summon search, the [GET parameter] setting will be ignored and the actual
;       current Summon search will be used instead.  The parameter only needs to be
;       specified when combining this module with a non-Summon-based search module.
; SummonBestBetsDeferred:[GET parameter]
;       Same as SummonBestBets, but loaded via AJAX.
; SummonDatabases:[GET parameter]
;       Display Summon-generated database recommendations matching the terms found
;       in the specified GET parameter.  NOTE: If you are using this module with a
;       Summon search, the [GET parameter] setting will be ignored and the actual
;       current Summon search will be used instead.  The parameter only needs to be
;       specified when combining this module with a non-Summon-based search module.
; SummonDatabasesDeferred:[GET parameter]
;       Same as SummonDatabases, but loaded via AJAX.
; SummonResults:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Display Summon search results matching the terms found in the specified
;       GET parameter (default = "lookfor"), limited to a specified number of
;       matches (default = 5).
; SummonResultsDeferred:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Same as SummonResults, but loaded via AJAX.
; SummonTopics:[GET parameter]
;       Display Summon-generated topic recommendations matching the terms found
;       in the specified GET parameter.  NOTE: If you are using this module with a
;       Summon search, the [GET parameter] setting will be ignored and the actual
;       current Summon search will be used instead.  The parameter only needs to be
;       specified when combining this module with a non-Summon-based search module.
; WebResults:[GET parameter]:[result limit]
;       Display website search results matching the terms found in the specified
;       GET parameter (default = "lookfor"), limited to a specified number of
;       matches (default = 5).  This requires the website Solr core to be active.
;
; Available modules recommended for use in the top area:
;
; AuthorFacets
;       Display author names based on the search term.
; AuthorInfo:[use_viaf]
;       Load author information from external providers based on the current search
;       and the "authors" setting in the [Content] section of config.ini.
;       The [use_viaf] setting may be set to true to use the VIAF web service in
;       combination with your Solr authority index to pick more appropriate authors;
;       this defaults to false if unset.  If you do not have local authority records
;       to draw on, the OCLC FAST data works well with the [use_viaf] option; see:
;       https://vufind.org/wiki/indexing:open_data_sources#oclc_fast
; AuthorityRecommend:[field1]:[query1]:[field2]:[query2]:...:[field-n]:[query-n]
;       Displays see and see also results to user based on search of Authority Index.
;       Any number of filter queries may be specified as parameters to limit which
;       set of authority records is used for recommendations; for example:
;           AuthorityRecommend:record_type:Heading* OR Topical*:source:FAST
;       limits record_type to strings starting with "Heading" or "Topical" and
;       limits source to FAST. A special field name of "__resultlimit__" may be
;       used to suppress authority results when the result set contains more items
;       than the number specified as the corresponding value (e.g. if you configure
;       AuthorityRecommend:__resultlimit__:50 then authority recommendations will
;       only display on result screens displaying fewer than 50 hits; by default,
;       recommendations will always display). A special field name of "__mode__"
;       may be used to control what type of suggestions are presented (default is
;       both seealso and usefor results, but you can turn on just one of these
;       options if desired; for example "__mode__:seealso" would only show "see
;       also" results from records whose main headings match the current search
;       terms while "__mode__:usefor" would show only main headings from records
;       whose "use for" headings match the current search. You can use "__mode__:*"
;       to turn on all options (but this is default behavior if no __mode__ is
;       set). Filtering is optional. A special field name of "__header__" may be
;       used to customize the header text above the results (default = "See also").
; Channels
;       Display a link to the Channeled Browse functionality leading to channels of
;       records related to the current search.
; MapSelection
;       Enable geographic searching capability by activating this module.
;       Records must be indexed using the geographic search and display fields.
;       See the marc_local.properties file for more information on indexing.
;       See the [MapSelection] section of the geofeatures.ini file for more information.
; PubDateVisAjax:[zooming]:[facet field 1]:[facet field 2]:...:[facet field n]
;       Display a visualization of publication dates for each of the specified facet
;       fields.  This is designed for a field containing four-digit years.  Zooming
;       is set to either true or false and controls whether or not selecting part of
;       the graph zooms in to greater detail.
; TopFacets:[ini section]:[ini name]
;       Display facets listed in the specified section of the specified ini file;
;       if [ini name] is left out, it defaults to "facets."
; VisualFacets:[ini section]:[ini name]
;        Supports visualizing pivot facet information as a treemap or circle
;        packing visualization. It must be used in combination with the "visual"
;        view in the [Views] section below -- it will only display in Visual mode.
;        [ini section] and [ini name] control where the module will load field
;        configurations from; it defaults to Visual_Settings in facets.ini.
; LearningMaterial
;       Recommends trying the Learning Material search tab (if configured) if the
;       user has selected the Learning Material filter.
;
; Available modules recommended for use in the "no results" area:
;
; AlphaBrowseLink:index
;       Use the query to generate a link to the specified alphabrowse index
; DOI:[prefix]:[redirect_exact_match]
;       Detect DOIs in the user search query. If a DOI makes up part of the search,
;       display a link to resolve it. If it makes up the entire query, redirect to
;       the resolver automatically. [prefix] is the URL of the resolver to which
;       the DOI itself will be appended. [redirect_exact_match] is a boolean; set it
;       to true if you want a search query that consists only of a DOI to redirect
;       automatically to the DOI resolver, or set it to false to only display a
;       message with a link. (Default is "true").
; ExternalSearch:[link label]:[url template]
;       Display a link to an external search system. The contents of the <a> tag
;       will be [link label] (which will be run through the translator -- use a
;       translation string if you need to display a string containing a colon).
;       The href will be [url template] with %%lookfor%% replaced with the current
;       search's lookfor parameter. If you omit the %%lookfor%% placeholder, the
;       search terms will simply be appended to the end of the URL template.
; Libraryh3lp:[type]:[id]:[skin]
;       Display a chat box for the Libraryh3lp service. [type] indicates the type
;       of chat being used (either "queue" or "user"). [id] is the name of the
;       queue or user. [skin] is optional and specifies a skin number to use.
; RecommendLinks:[ini section]:[ini name]
;       Display a list of recommended links, taken from [ini section] in
;       [ini name], where the section is a mapping of label => URL. [ini name]
;       defaults to searches.ini, and [ini section] defaults to RecommendLinks.
; RemoveFilters
;       Suggests removing facet filters to retrieve more results.
; SwitchQuery:[backend]:[opt-out checks to skip]:[opt-in checks to add]
;       This module analyzes the user's query and offers suggestions for ways to
;       improve it. [backend] is the name of the search backend currently in use,
;       which will help with accurate analysis (default = Solr). [opt-out checks
;       to skip] is a comma-separated list of checks which are on by default but
;       which you wish to disable. [opt-in checks to add] is a comma-separated
;       list of transforms that are off by default but which you wish to enable.
;       See the check*() methods in the module's code for a complete list of
;       available checks. The $optInMethods property specifies which checks are
;       turned off by default.
; SwitchTab
;       If multiple tabs are active, suggest that the user try searching in a
;       different one.
; SwitchType:[field]:[field description]
;       If the current search type is not the same as [field], display a link
;       suggesting that the user try switching to [field].  [field description]
;       is the human-readable description of [field].  Default values are
;       'AllFields' and 'All Fields' respectively.
; FinnaSuggestions:[apiUrl]:[siteUrl]
;       Performs the same search to another Finna site via API [apiUrl].
;       When results are found, displays a link to the search results [siteUrl].
;       Recommendations are presented only for basic searches using AllFields handler
;       and no filters. URLs are configured without protocol, for example:
;       api.finna.fi/Search/Results?querystring
;
; Available modules recommended for use in the "results top" area:
;
; OntologyDeferred:[ini section]:[ini name]
;       Provides ontology based recommendations as configured in the specified
;       section of the specified ini file; if [ini name] is left out, it
;       defaults to "searches" and if [ini section] is left out, it defaults to
;       "OntologyModuleRecommendations".
;
; You can build your own recommendations modules if you wish.  See the developer's
; guide here:
;
;       http://vufind.org/wiki/vufind2:recommendation_modules

; This section controls the "New Items" search.
[NewItem]
; Comma-separated list of date ranges to offer to the user (i.e. 1,5,30 = one day
; old, or five days old, or thirty days old).  Be careful about raising the maximum
; age too high -- searching very long date ranges may put a load on your ILS.
ranges = 1,5,30
; This setting controls the maximum number of pages of results that will show up
; when doing a new item search.  It is necessary to limit the number of results to
; avoid getting a "too many boolean clauses" error from the Solr index (see notes
; at http://vufind.org/jira/browse/VUFIND-128 for more details).  However, if you
; set the value too low, you may get the same results no matter which range setting
; is selected!
result_pages = 10
; This setting can be used to automatically apply filter queries to the New Item
; results.  For example, you might want to filter out certain content types.  You
; can add multiple filters by repeating the "filter[] =" line, or you can skip
; filtering entirely by leaving the line commented out.
; filter[] = "format:Book"

; This section controls RSS feed behavior
[RSS]
; If set, this setting will override sort settings associated with RSS feeds.  This
; allows you to ensure that newly added or changed items in your index appear at
; the top of the feed.  Use "first_indexed desc" if you only want newly-added items
; to be listed first.  Use "last_indexed desc" if you want newly-added-or-changed
; items.  Comment out the whole setting if you do not want custom RSS sorting.
; IMPORTANT: In order for first_indexed and last_indexed sorting to work properly,
;            you need to index record change dates; see the Wiki page at
;            http://vufind.org/wiki/tracking_record_changes
sort = "last_indexed desc,id asc"

; The following two sections control the behavior of the autocomplete drop-downs
; associated with search boxes.  The [Autocomplete] section contains global default
; settings, while the [Autocomplete_Types] section allows you to associate different
; autocomplete handlers with different search handlers.
;
; The available autocomplete handlers are:
;
; None
;       Do not provide any suggestions.  You should use this handler if you want to
;       disable suggestions for one search type while still providing suggestions
;       for other search types.  To disable suggestions completely, it is better to
;       use the "enabled" setting in the [Autocomplete] section.
; SolrAuth:[Search Handler]:[Display Field]:[Sort Field]:[Filters]
;       See Solr below -- this handler behaves exactly the same, except
;       it uses the Solr authority data index rather than the bibliographic index,
;       and its default [Display Field] value is "heading".
; Solr:[Search Handler]:[Display Field]:[Sort Field]:[Filters]
;       Perform a wildcarded search against [Search Handler], using the contents of
;       [Display Field] (a comma-separated, priority-ordered field list) as
;       suggestions and sorting by [Sort Field].  Any additional parameters at the
;       end of the string are treated as an alternating sequence of field names and
;       values for use as filters against the suggestion list.  All parameters are
;       optional.  If omitted, [Search Handler] will use the default Solr field,
;       [Display Field] will use "title", [Sort Field] will use relevance and no
;       filters will be applied.
; SolrCN
;       A customized version of Solr designed for smart handling of
;       call numbers using the custom CallNumber search handler.
; Tag
;       Provide suggestions from the local database of tags.
;
; You can build your own autocomplete modules if you wish.  See the developer's
; guide here:
;
;       http://vufind.org/wiki/vufind2:autosuggesters

; The following options control (optional) autocomplete sections
; that are displayed in the following order after the search suggestions:
;
; 1. Filters
;   Static links to filtered search results using the current search term.
;   The links are displayed even when no suggestions are found, but only when
;   Preserve filters -option is not selected (to prevent conflicting
;   filter settings that return no results).
;
;   filters[] = [operator][field]:[value]&[operator][field]:[value]|[label]|[tab1&tab2]
;
;   Each filter link consists of the following options delimited by '|':
;     - [operator][field]:[value] filter items delimited by '&'
;     - [label] Filter label translation key.
;               Note: the key should not contain special characters (for example whitespace, punctuation, '-').
;     - [tab] Search tabs where the filter should be displayed, delimited by '&'.
;             If none specified, the filter is shown on all tabs.
;   Example:
;     filters[] = "building:2/JYU/100/3/|coursebooks|Solr"
;     filters[] = "tlevel:peer_reviewed&tlevel:online_resources|primo_fulltext|Primo"
;
; 2. Facets
;   Facets for the returned search suggestions.
;
;   facets[] = [facet]||[filters]|[limit]|[tab1&tab2]
;
;   Each facet consists of the following options delimited by '|':
;     - [facet]   Facet field
;     - [filters] Optional restriction for an acceptable facet value
;     - [limit]   Optional maximum number of values to be displayed
;     - [tab]     Search tabs where the facet should be displayed, delimited by '&'.
;                 If none specified, the facet is shown on all tabs.
;
;   Examples:
;     facets[] = "online_boolean"
;     facets[] = "building|2/JYU/100/3/"
;     facets[] = "format|0/Book/"
;     facets[] = "format||3|Solr"
;
;   Facet value translation can be overridden by defining a translation key "autocomplete_[facet]:[value]",
;   for example "autocomplete_building:2/JYU/100/3/"
;
; 3. Phrase search
;   Search option for performing a phrase earch using the current search term.
;
;   phrase = 0|1
;
; 4. Search handlers
;   Search handlers for performing a search using the current search term and selected handler.
;
;   handlers[] = "[handler]|[label]"
;
;   Each handler consists of the following options delimited by '|':
;     - [handler] Handler
;     - [label]   Handler label translation key.
;                 Note: the key should not contain special characters (for example whitespace, punctuation, '-').
;
;   Example:
;     handlers[] = "Title|autocomplete_handler_title"
;
; 5. ISBN
;   If isbn=true and the search query matches an ISBN from the search results, the record with the matching ISBN
;   will be displayed at the top of autocomplete sections (above search suggestions).
